    React, Universally starter kit contains all the build tooling and configuration you need to kick off your next universal React project, whilst containing a minimal project set up allowing you to make your own architecture decisions (Redux/Mobx etc).
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an extended, slighty more opinionated version of the React, Universally application template.
  </p>
